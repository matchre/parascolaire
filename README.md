This is my website for my programming class https://robertvandeneynde.be/parascolaire/

The website is **static** meaning you can test it in your browser by opening the html files.
However, there are a lot of **generated** files.
Those are generated by python 3 without any additional module.
The generated files are read-only and should therefore not be modified.

To generate the files, dowload the last version of python on [](python.org).
Then, on windows, double-click the `generate.bat` whereas on Mac or Linux, type `bash generate` or `./generate` if you made the file executable, make sure the `python3` command is available.

You can help with the translation by modifying the non read only files.
